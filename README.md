## Here we have two files

- General Roadmap: Contains the full roadmap as headlines and each one has some suggested courses. <br>
- Sheduled Roadmap (recommended): The same roadmap, but a specific course was chosen in each subject and it was divided into weeks, at a studying rate of 8 hours per week.
